# 隱私權政策

This privacy policy explains what data we collect and store; how we use and disclose this data.

**重要提示**：此文件適用於 Web Scobbler 版本 v2.40.0 及以上。

## 哪些資料會被蒐集？

此擴充功能不會蒐集您的任何個人資料。

## 此擴充功能儲存了什麼資料？

Your settings and credentials are stored within your browser. The extension stores:

- Your credentials of scrobble services
- 您個人的 Web Scrobbler 設定
- 您編輯的曲目
- 您為 Connectors 設定的 URL 規則
- 此擴充功能的系統資訊

Your credentials are used to communicate with scrobble services only.

All data is used by the extension internally; we don't send this data to 3rd-party services.

## 為何此擴充功能需要存取所有網站？

The extension supports several self-hosted services (e.g. Funkwhale), which are supposed to have user-defined URLs. The extension could not know these URLs, that's why access to all websites is required.

Also, it asks accessing for user convenience only. Users will not be prompted to confirm access to new websites added in new extension versions.
